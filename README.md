# encoding_using_java

Hi friends, 
            I will just give a little brief about how i got the idea of doing this. I was reading a article about Crypto miner malware used by the hacker group to get access to the victim device by a Google translate desktop software which is not the official one but it was developed by the hacker group so that the victims who download the software from the Nitrokod website the inbuilt malware gets infected like slow poison at one stage of the attack hackers had tried to encoded the json file in the following steps below:
            
            1.Convert JSON to String.
            2.Reverse the String.
            3.Encode the String with base 64.
            4.Reverse the encoded String.
            5.Encode the string with base 64.
 
 It really stuck in my mind so I had tried to code this. You all can also try this by running code and download the json file for example. I will try to modify and make it useful for many use cases in near future.
